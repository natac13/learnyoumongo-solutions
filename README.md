My solutions for learnyoumongo which I was working on by following the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) curriculum. More workshops can also be found at [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/), which I and working through as they are open sourced projects from other community members.

I have been learning ES6, so I have babel setup to transpile the ES6 code in the root directory to the ES5/ folder which I then used those files to run `learnyoumongo verify [filename]`.
